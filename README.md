# Emotion-Detector

This project aims to understand AI and open source tools by building an AI model that interprets facial expressions. Starting with Python, we'll capture images, use OpenCV and Dlib for face detection, and leverage Face_recognition or ArcFace for analysis. A machine learning model, trained on extracted features, will classify emotions, intensity, age, and gender. Open-source libraries like OpenCV and Motion offer video processing options. By exploring these tools and customizing code, we can delve deeper into AI and build exciting applications!
